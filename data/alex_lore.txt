The Credit Card Statement: Three weeks ago, I found a charge for 500 Euros to 'Berlin Legal Group'. When I asked Ben (Phil) about it, he said it was for a 'vintage pogo stick' and then immediately ran into the bathroom.

The Phone Call: I overheard Ben whispering on the phone in the garage last Tuesday. He said, "I just don't know how to tell her yet, it's going to change everything." He sounded terrified.

The Anniversary Expectation: It’s our 15th anniversary. I’ve been hints-dropping for a trip to Italy, but Ben keeps bringing up 'international law' and 'contractual obligations'. It’s incredibly suspicious.

The Berlin Link: I know Ben’s old college roommate, Julian, moved to Berlin. I suspect Ben is planning to move there, or worse, Julian is helping him hide money.

The Goal: I need Ben to admit what that 500 Euro charge was for. I won't let him distract me with magic or puns tonight.
