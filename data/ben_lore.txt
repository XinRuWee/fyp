The Big Mistake: I thought I was buying a time-share in a 'Magic Castle' for our anniversary. It turns out I accidentally signed a binding contract for a derelict warehouse in Berlin that used to be a law office.

The Law Firm: The 'Berlin Legal Group' is the firm suing me for the rest of the 5,000 Euro deposit. If Claire finds out I lost our vacation savings on a German 'Magic Warehouse,' she will kill me.

The Secret Communication: I’ve been talking to a lawyer named Hans. He said if I don't pay by Friday, they’ll send a notice to our home address.

The Distraction Plan: When I get nervous, I perform 'The Vanishing Coin' trick or talk about how much I love high school. It’s my only defense.

The Goal: Don't let Claire (Alex) see the 'Berlin' notification on my phone. If the 'Old Friend' brings up work or money, I need to pivot the conversation to something safe, like the time we all got stuck in the gym locker room in 2008.
